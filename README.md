**Plur** is both an application framework and a nodal network cloud platform that scales apps and services across VMs.

The **framework** provides reusable cross-platform JS libraries for rapid development of both front-end and server-side applications. Applications are **interconnected** as plur *nodes* out of the box. The API also provides basic identity, authentication, and message passing.

The cloud **platform** builds on top of the framework, scaling core API services across a nodal network that we call a plur **cloud**. Each plur _cloud_ operates as simple network appliance that may be started and stopped at will. Internally, the cloud contains plur **nodes** that control VMs, authenticate requests, route messages, and scale any apps or services developed with the plur framework.

The API attempts to use JS as an **enterprise** language by following closely behind the ECMA language standard's progress. The plur library is designed to operate normally **without transpilng or compiling**. The JS library **doesn't pollute** or modify the existing global namespace. Traditional enterprise language features that are still "upcoming" in the JS standard are implemented by **convention**, using a single coding and documentation standard. Only two upcoming language features are implemeted by code: class **namespaces** and **interfaces**. All library features are available to any class by using the API's ```PlurObject.plurify()``` utility any time after declaration.
