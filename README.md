(This project is in an early development stage.)

Plur is a distributed Web3 application platform that is intended to scale across networks of virtual machines. The framework
is designed to improve cross-platform code reuse by allowing most of the same libraries to be imported on both backend and
frontend applications.

One or more plur services run on each plur network node (application), communicating with local services directly
and with remote services through encrypted message forwarding.

Plur networks are controlled by management services that receive and react to metrics from other plur services as well
as to new directives by the network administrators. Management services start, stop, and reconfigure other plur
services dynamically, based on changing operational requirements.

Common third-party software services (e.g., PostgreSQL, Memcached, etc.) are isolated from communicating with anything other than their locally running plur node, which forwards only authorized requests from application servers.
