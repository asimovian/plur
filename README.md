**Plur** is both an application framework and a nodal network cloud platform that scales apps and services across VMs.

The **framework** provides reusable cross-platform JS libraries for rapid development of both front-end and server-side applications. Applications are interconnected as plur _nodes_ out of the box. The API also provides basic identity, authentication, and message passing.

The cloud **platform** builds on top of the framework, providing scalable network services that control the plur _cloud_, control VMs, authenticate roles and requests, and route messages between nodes based on _roles_ and technical _capabilties_.
