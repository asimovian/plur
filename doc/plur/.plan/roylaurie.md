Repository Under Construction
=============================

I'm adding pieces from older implementations to the new plur repository as well as throwing in messy draft / psuedo-code.

Nothing to see here yet.

Currently ...
-------------

Working on compile issues and unit test code coverage for all public API methods as well as standardizing code style and doc templates.

Recently ...
------------
Fixed all initial errors and warnings generated by Google's Closure Compiler.

Created a very basic testing framework for unit tests.

Merged all pre-existing libraries into one area and generally standardized them to fit with the new structure.
